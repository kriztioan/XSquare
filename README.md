# XSquare

`XSquare` is a 2D side-scrolling platform game development playground. It is written in `C++` and relies on `X11`, `X11's Back-buffer Extension`, and `libpng`. Rather than offering a completed game, `XSquare` explores some basic game development concepts, e.g., separating out interface-, engine-, video-, audio-, level-, and networking; level design; using sprites; and other things.

`XSquare` will run on `Linux` and `MacOS`, where the former requires `OSS` support for sound, and the latter the [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org) X11 window manager installed.

## Usage

`XSquare` program is compiled with:

```shell
make
```

This results in a binary executable called `xsquare`, which is invoked with:

```shell
./xsquare
```

## Notes

1. On `MacOS` `XCode` and the developer tools needs to be installed.
2. On `Ubuntu` the `osspd-alsa` package is needed for sound.
3. Both `Linux` and `MacOS` require `libpng`.
